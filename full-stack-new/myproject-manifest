Tutorworld application:

Need to create the below APIs,

Tutor registartion, tutor login, get all tutors--> done
when tutor login, he should able to see his profile --> for this we need to create the profile of tutor--> for this need to create the route to get
all details of respective tutor, we can get those details by JWT token(need to decode that token) --> Done

forgot password, update password-- > we can work later

parent registration, parent Login ---> Done

once parent Login, he should able to see all the tutors available in the site. --> this we can implement from UI.

My own E-Commerce APP:

need to create the registration page --> first name, last name, mobile, email, password, Address
Need to create the Login page

I need to create the add product page for only admin user, so that we can add products to application, 

Once user logged in--> I need to show all the products (images with prices) in a page with ADD button on each and every product, if he hit on ADD--> it should get updated to
his cart.

or else I need to create the page with all products with prices, and in the same page, we can provide the one drop down to below items
  1) Item
  2) how many units/kgs
  3) price --> it should be updated automatically.

Redux notes:

reducers : it is used maintain the application data and contribute to application state. And all reducers are child of root reducer which is in app

containers: containers are used when your component want to react with redux to get the data

store: It will store the application state.

action: When user performs a action, i.e., click on a button, hovering a mouse, etc

work flow:
------
component ---> container --> action --> reducer --> root reducer --> store ---> container --> component
